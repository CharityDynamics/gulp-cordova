# Add a splashscreen

The plugin `gulp-cordova-splash` is in the works, but for now you can add a splashscreen by using `gulp-cordova-xml`
and add the the correct xml tags and put the splash screen in the correct place. More information can be found at
the cordova website in the section [Icons and Splash screens](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.0.0/config_ref_images.md.html#Icons%20and%20Splash%20Screens).
